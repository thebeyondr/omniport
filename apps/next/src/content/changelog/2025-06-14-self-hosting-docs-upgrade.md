We've revamped our [**self-hosting docs**](https://docs.llmgateway.io/self-host) to make it easier than ever to run LLM Gateway on your own terms.

## 🚀 Simple Setup with Docker

Get started in seconds with our streamlined Docker approach:

**One-command deployment** Single Docker image gets you running instantly

**Zero-config local testing** Try everything on your machine with minimal setup

**Quick prototyping** Perfect for development and small team usage

## 🏗️ Production-Grade with Docker Compose

For teams ready to scale and organizations with enterprise needs:

**Multi-service** Database, Redis, Gateway, API, Docs, and UI in separate containers

**Keys** Centralized key management via .env var

All of the docker images are public so you can fully customize the hosting to your needs.

Whether you're just getting started with a single Docker command or building a production-grade deployment with Docker Compose – LLM Gateway now makes it easier to go self-hosted at any scale.
